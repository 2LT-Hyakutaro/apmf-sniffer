# APMF sniffer
## Intended usage
`APMFsniffer` is a library that uses the rust `libpcap` library to capture packets on Windows, Linux and macOS.\
The library allows the user to capture packet on a user specified network adapter
by setting it in promiscuous mode, and generates reports on the traffic observed after
a specified time interval.\
The report is organized by source and destination port and address, and shows information
about the number of bytes exchanged, the transport and application protocols (see caveats section for the application layer information limitations), and a time of first and last
packet exchange.
## Installing pcap on your platform
The information for installing pcap is available on the rust `libpcap` github (https://github.com/rust-pcap/pcap).
For Windows the library suggested is no longer maintained, so you should install `Npcap`
instead, together with the `Npcap` SDK, and add the sdk to your environment variables

## Caveats
* This library assumes that your WLAN interface/driver transaltes 802.11 data pacjets to "fake" Ethernet packets
* In order to give *some* information about the application protocol contained in the packets, this library uses the simplest (and least accurate) identification method: port-based identification. This is also limited to just *some* of the 1024 well know ports.

## Errors
Most public functions return a `Result`, the possible errors are the following:

* `NoSuchDevice`: the device name does not correspond to any available device
* `IllegalAction`: when the function cannot be called given the current device status (e.g. calling `pause` when the capture is already paused)
* `RustPcapError`: wrapper for an error of the underlying library `libpcap`
* `ParsingError`: wrapper for errors generated by the library used for the packets parsing `etherparse`
* `DisconnectedThread`: the capture thread has unexpectedly disconnected
* `InternalError`: unspecified internal error, indicates a bug with the library
* `PacketNotRecognized`: the packet that is being parsed is not supported by the library

Only some of this error are returned by public functions, others are used only internally.

## How to use
To use the library, create a `APMFSniffer` and use the functions `start`, `pause` and `resume` to control the sniffing process. \
```rust
fn main() {
    let dev_name = "dev1";
    let delta_t = 10000; // milliseconds
    let file_name = "/home/report.csv";
    let device = init(dev.as_str(), delta_t, file_name).unwrap();
    device.start().unwrap(); // starts capture
}
```
